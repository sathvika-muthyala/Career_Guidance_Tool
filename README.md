Problem/Opportunity:
In today's competitive job market, students and professionals often struggle to identify the right skills required for their
dream jobs at their target companies. The lack of a structured career roadmap and real-time insights into industry
trends makes it challenging for individuals to focus on the most in-demand skills. Additionally, students may not have
access to a comprehensive tool that provides personalized recommendations based on their current skills and career
aspirations.
This project presents an opportunity to leverage data science and machine learning to develop an interactive career
guidance tool that analyzes a user's skills, suggests areas for improvement, and provides real-time job market insights.
By integrating predictive analytics, skill mapping, and company-specific recommendations, this tool will empower
individuals to make data-driven career decisions.
Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered career guidance system that analyzes a user's skills and
provides personalized recommenda>ons for skill development based on their target job roles and
companies. This system will feature an interac>ve dashboard with func>onali>es such as real->me job
market insights, progress tracking, and salary trend predic>ons. By u>lizing data-driven insights, this tool will
help users make informed career decisions and op>mize their learning paths to achieve their professional
goals.
The project will be measured by the accuracy of the predic>ve models, the eﬀec>veness of skill
recommenda>ons, and user engagement with the dashboard. The en>re project is expected to be
completed within 2 months, leveraging exis>ng job market datasets and machine learning techniques.

Objectives:

-
Objec&ve 1:
Outcome: Develop a machine learning model to assess a user’s skills and suggest missing or underdeveloped
skills for their target job.
Time Frame: Within 2 months
Measure: Achieve at least 85% accuracy in skill recommendation predictions.
Action: Collect and preprocess job market data, train machine learning models, and evaluate the accuracy of
recommendations.

-

Objec&ve 2:
Outcome: Implement a real-time job market insights dashboard to track in-demand skills and latest job postings.
Time Frame: Within 2 months
Measure: Display job postings from at least 5 major job boards and track skill demand trends.
Action: Integrate job market APIs, extract insights, and visualize trends on the dashboard.
-

Objec&ve 3:
Outcome: Create a company-specific skill recommendation system where users can choose their target company
and receive personalized skill suggestions.
Time Frame: Within 1 month
Measure: Provide accurate skill recommendations for at least 50 companies based on historical job postings.
Action: Scrape and analyze job descriptions, identify required skills, and integrate a recommendation engine.

-

Objec&ve 4:
Outcome: Develop a progress-tracking feature where users can mark skills as 'In Progress' or 'Completed'.
Time Frame: Within 1 month
Measure: At least 80% of users engage with and update their skill progress.
Action: Build a database for tracking user progress and develop an intuitive UI for updates.

Objec&ve 5:
trends.
Outcome: Implement a salary prediction model to forecast salary trends based on skills, experience, and market
Time Frame: Within 2 months
Measure: Achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 80% on validation datasets.
Action: Collect salary data, preprocess it, and train a regression model to forecast salary trends.


Success Criteria:
The project will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:
-
The skill recommendation model achieves an accuracy of at least 85%.
-
The job market insights dashboard successfully integrates real-time job postings and skill demand trends.
-
The company-specific recommendation feature provides relevant skill suggestions for at least 50 companies.
-
The progress-tracking feature is effectively used by at least 80% of users.
-
The salary prediction model forecasts salary trends with an accuracy of at least 80%.
-
The project is completed within three months, with all objectives met within their respective timelines.
-
The final system provides valuable career insights, improving users' career planning and job preparation
efficiency.
Assumptions, Risks, Obstacles:
Several factors may affect the outcome of this project. One key assumption is that the dataset used for skill
analysis and job market trends is accurate and representative of real-world hiring trends. However, limitations
such as missing or biased data could impact the model’s effectiveness.
Another risk involves integrating real-time job market data, which may face API restrictions, data inconsistencies,
or access limitations. Additionally, ensuring user engagement is crucial for the effectiveness of the interactive
dashboard.
External factors, including shifts in job market demands, changes in hiring trends, or economic downturns, could
influence the system’s ability to provide accurate insights. Continuous updates and model improvements will be
necessary to maintain relevance.
